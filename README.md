# Deep-Learning-Happy-and-Sad-Image-Classification-using-CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of happy and sad people. The CNN model is implemented with layers of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning and scaling the images, and then split into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

### Results:
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 1.0
Accuracy: 1.0
These results indicate that the model performs perfectly in classifying images of happy and sad people.
